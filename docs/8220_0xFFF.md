[$UPPOSED TO BE.](https://2by.me/8049-is-dead-again) 
so i had the new `sub` in my mind and wanted to shift things downstream.

Turns out there is google in my NameCheap!
*ewwww!!!*

So I goto nc.

A|`"`|55.199.198.156
---|---|---
CNAME|`www`|ingressGh/N\Com

Then I mutate it to 

..|..|..
---|---|---
A|`"`|55.199.198.156
A|`somwhr`|185.199.108.153
CNAME|`www`|ingressGh/N\Com

and finally add a CNAME in github/repo [#28ec.52](https://github.com/7o6/7o6.github.io/commit/28ec3526ebc56556f6becb78a6014c00cc2cd19a)

> Now
 
There must be something other than a 404. [@somwhr.2by.me](https://somwhr.2by.me)

### No! I have something, though..
ffx says
```
Your connection is not secure

The owner of somwhr.2by.me has configured their website improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox has not connected to this website.

This site uses HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to specify that Firefox may only connect to it securely. As a result, it is not possible to add an exception for this certificate.
```
Okay. Lets just -remove `HTTP/2` from our gh-setti.
So we add it.

Meanwhile, it has propagated?
```
xe8220_xpx36 ~ $ dig +noall +answer somwhr.2by.me
somwhr.2by.me.		300	IN	A	185.199.108.153
xe8220_xpx36 ~ $ dig +noall +answer 7o6.github.io
7o6.github.io.		3600	IN	A	185.199.108.153
7o6.github.io.		3600	IN	A	185.199.110.153
7o6.github.io.		3600	IN	A	185.199.111.153
7o6.github.io.		3600	IN	A	185.199.109.153
xe8220_xpx36 ~ $ 
```

Since both match, and instead I added a `CNAME` at my `DNS%20Reg`, it propagated within my set `TTL`: ***5 mins.***.

You can open the connection settiings and look if your `SHA-1` fingerprint for `7o6.github.io` IRL resolves to :`CC:86:68:5A:BB:28:65:F6:4E:84:7B:8E:E8:0E:EC:F7:A5:53:A3:AF`.

*For the `BYME Network home, its @ `00:AD:9A:CA:EE:23:9F:D9:71:0C:4B:05:C1:76:41:E0:CA:ED:BB:64`*.

And furthered bluency by adding a `%3C%` in my `README`. ~~poly wows~~

## But how did the *55.199.198.156* get there?
Personally, idk that â„–, tbjh

###  But just then
```
Error occured: INVALID_ADDR : '185.199.108.153' should not be an IP/ URL for CNAME record.(host name: 8049)
```

So theres is this thing where i always get muddled up.

Revervse gluing.

The web is broken.

We need NS-service providers, like ENS by eth, eos, bitcoin, on those terms.. like say the TorP..

But lets wait for it to propogate.
