### What we learnt today :
About the advanced DNS `--option`$
#### About `CNAME` records

#### About `A` records
In words of Maria, _An `A`-record (address record) allows one to associate a name ( domain, or subdomain) with an existin’ `IP`-address (point) which is `32-bit`._

#### About `CNAME` records
In words of Maria, _Any `CNAME`-record (Canonical 'name' record) allows one to associate a *host-name* ( a domain, or subdomain) with an existing `hostName`._

### Easy info™ :
`A-record` is THE record.
CNAME is any other A-record pointin to any existing, _other_ `A-record`.
